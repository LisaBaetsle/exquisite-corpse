# Smile while you still have teeth

Once upon a time in a beautiful forest there was a little girl.
She lived with her grandparents and was very happy.
On her 7th birthday, she got a puppy.

In a belated  effort to rhyme, the puppy's tail had a twirl.
He would run the girl's errands and his ears were all flappy.
He didn't make his 7th birthday, and was replaced by a guppy.
