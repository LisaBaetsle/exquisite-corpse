# Smile while you still have teeth

Once upon a time in a beautiful forest there was a little girl.  
She lived with her grandparents and was very happy.  
On her 7th birthday, she got a puppy.

She gave a name to her puppy. His name will be **Bruno**, she said!

Bruno become her best friend, they were always _together_.
