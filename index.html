	<h1>Everything happens for a reason</h1>
	<h2>It truly does</h2>
	<p>Yesterday, I went to the park to play some basketbal with my sister-in-law.</p>
	<p>My brother made the mistake to buy a size 5 basketball.</p>
	<p>This size is developed for children aged 8 untill 13.</p>
	<p>We decided to play volleyball instead. I haven't played volleyball since primary school.</p>
	<p>I was so really good in volleyball back then!</p>
	<p>I went to different tournaments and won a looot of prizes!</p>
	<p>But while I had my head in clouds someone stole his sneakers that he took off cause they were not comfortable.</p>
	<p>I found them online and had to buy them back for three packs of gum.</p>
	<p>The seller chewed all of the gum at once and farted out a perfect size 7 basketball.</p>
