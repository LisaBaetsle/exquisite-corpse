    <h1>Everything happens for a reason</h1>
    <h2>It truly does</h2>
    <p>Yesterday, I went to the park to play some basketbal with my sister-in-law</p>
    <p>My brother made the mistake to buy a size 5 basketball.</p>
    <p>This size is developed for children aged 8 untill 13.</p>
    <p>We decided to play volleyball instead. I haven't played volleyball since primary school.</p>
    <p>I was so really good in volleyball back then!</p>
